# Abstract:

Shapeshifter Culture describes a society that emerges from a space in which all citizens and participants have the ability to alter their forms and functions, as well as those of their objects including the surrounding ‘world’, completely and freely at will. Through immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality, the study of avatr interactions will offer new insight into how people interact when their actions are not tethered to a singular physical form.
